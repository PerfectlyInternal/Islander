<h1>Contributing guidelines</h1>
Welcome to the Islander contributer community. I'm glad that you have decided to join us, regardless of your skill or ability. These contributing guidelines are simple rules for new contributors that will help you get an idea of how to help out.

<h2>Getting started</h2>
The files currently in the master branch are all set for you to download and use. There is already a Visual Studio project set up there, so use it to your advantage. The project has no dependencies that aren't either part of the repository or just standard libraries. If you use any other editor, ignore the Visual Studio files and set up the project manually. Add the include folder as an include directory and the lib folder as a library directory. Add glfw3.lib as a library file. Now you're ready to begin contributing.

<h2>I have a feature idea or otehr improvement</h2>
  * If you have an idea for a feature, submit an issue, and we will decide whether or not to include it.
  * Anyone can have a say in whether or not the feature is a good idea

<h2>I found a bug!</h2>
  * If you find a bug, make sure it is not yet reported in an issue by searching for it. 
  * If you are sure that you have discovered a unique bug, report it in an issue, and, if possible, propose a solution. 
  * Make sure to include as much relevant info as possible, such as location in the code, you build environment, etc.

<h2>I fixed a bug!</h2>
  * If you fixed a bug, good job! Create a pull request to let us know that the bug is fixed.
  * If the fix works for everyone, we will approve the pull request and you patch will be added.
