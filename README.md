# Islander
A simple island survival game based on OpenGL. Many things are yet to be implemented, such as the survival part.

This project began as a hobby. Do not expect particularly high quality code or readable, if any, documentation.

Visit [Our contribution guidelines](https://github.com/SashaM69420/Islander/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before beginning to contribute.

Current features:
- Procedural terrain generation
- Basic shading
- Loading screen

Currently in development:
- Documentation
- Better terrain generation
  - Caves
  - Plants
  - Islands that aren't boring

To be implemented in the future:
- Menu system
- Saving islands instead of making new ones each time
- Shadows (really need help with this one)

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
